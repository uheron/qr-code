### What I learned

Since I am a react-native developer, it was a little bit challenging for me to start with pure HTML/CSS. Once I got a grasp of it, it was not too complex. 
I am very proud of being able to add custom fonts because I always have issues with fonts. 
The biggest challenge I faced was the fact that my browser kept caching styles. Therefore, it took me some time to figure out why styles were not updating.

### Useful resources

- [w3 school](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Helped me with basic HTML/CSS syntax
